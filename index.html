          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>Dr. Borlaug was born in Iowa in 1914. His parents were immigrants from Norway and had a long heritage of subsistence farming stretching all the way to the homecountry.</p>

          <div class="education">
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>He went to the University of Minnesota for his undergraduate degree. After graduating, he started working for the United States Forestry Service.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="career">
          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>He went on to work for the US Forestry Service for about a year before being laid off. He then decided to go back to school to pursue a PhD. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</p>
          <p>After graduating, he spurned a high-paying career with Dupont, choosing instead to take a low-paying job in Mexico working to establish a plant pathology program. During this time, he discovered a way to grow wheat twice in a growing season, effectively doubling yields. He went on to use genetics to discover a high-yield wheat strain that would go on to make up the bulk of Mexico's total wheat yield. </p>
          <p>He would then take those high-yield wheat strains to India to try to mitigate widespread drought that had been ravaging the region mostly due to a rapidly growing population.</p>
          <p>For his efforts, the Nobel Committee awarded him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his role in averting the deaths of many people around the world. The 1980s would also see massive population growth on the African continent and Dr. Borlaug continued his mission there working with several African countries to improve food crop yields. He was awarded a distinguished professorship at Texas A&M University where he remained until his death in 2009.</p>
